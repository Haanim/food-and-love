      <td>One</td>

    My grandmother and aunties frequently complained about food cooked by others by saying <italic>"Bawang tak tumis betul"</italic>. Meaning, the onions were not fried properly, or for long enough. This is a common pitfall among cooks less worthy than them because they lack patience and therefore destroy the entire dish.
    <br>
    <br>
    The base of so many Malaysian dishes is fried onions and garlic. Onions must be fried until they are translucent in most dishes. You can add the garlic a little after you've added the onions so you don't burn them. But I throw it all in at once, I don't mind a little burn on my onions and garlic.
  </p>
  <table class="recipe center">
    <tr>
      <th>Measurements</th>
      <th>Ingredients</th> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1 packet</td>
      <td>Chicken or Tofu</td>
</table>
<p>
    I have been advised to cook the chicken without liquids for a few seconds. This seals the outer layer. I don't know why, but I know there is good wisdom behind it. 
    </p>

  <table class="recipe center">
    <tr>
      <th>Measurements</th>
      <th>Ingredients</th> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>100ml</td>
      <td >Soya Sauce</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>50ml</td>
      <td>Oyster Sauce</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>100ml</td>
        <td>Water</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Half a can</td>
        <td>Canned Tomatoes</td>
      </tr>
  </table>
  <br>
  <p>
Now you can add all the liquids. If you cook chicken fillet or breasts, it won't take long to cook. If the chicken you use has bones, you need more time to boil this dish, so just add more water.
    <br>
    <br>
Taste it once the chicken is done. If it needs more salt, add soya sauce. If it needs more sweetness, add oyster sauce. If it's too sweet/salty, add water.

Best served with plain rice. </p>
